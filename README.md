## Step 1: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npx react-native run-android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npx react-native run-ios
```
